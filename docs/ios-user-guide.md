### iOS-Specific Features

#### Files Integration

Notter integrates with the iOS Files app, allowing you to:

All your notes are available offline once they've been loaded. Changes you make while offline will be saved locally and synchronized when you're back online (if using iCloud Drive).

### Permissions Issues

If Notter cannot access your files:

1. Open the iOS Settings app

## Tips for iOS Users
