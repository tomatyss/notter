## Basic Search

### Accessing the Search

The search functionality is located in the sidebar of the Notter application, between the Settings panel and the Notes list.

### Performing a Search

1. Click on the search input field
2. Type your search query
3. Results will appear automatically as you type
4. Click on any result to view the full note

### What Gets Searched

When you search in Notter, the application looks through:

- **Note titles**: The headings of your notes
- **Note content**: The full text of your notes
- **Tags**: Any tags associated with your notes

## Search Tips and Tricks

### Effective Search Queries

For the best results:

- **Use specific terms**: Instead of searching for "meeting", try "budget meeting" or "team meeting"
- **Include unique words**: Words that are likely to appear in only the notes you're looking for
- **Keep it simple**: The search engine works best with straightforward queries

### Finding Recent Notes

To find notes from a specific time period, include date-related terms in your search:

- "yesterday meeting"
- "last week project"
- "March budget"

### Finding Notes by Topic

To find notes related to a specific topic:

- Include topic-specific terminology
- Search for related tags (e.g., "project" will match notes with #project tag)
- Combine topic terms with other identifying information

## Understanding Search Results

### Result Ranking

Search results are ranked by relevance, with:

- Matches in titles given highest priority
- Matches in tags given medium priority
- Matches in content given standard priority

This means that if your search term appears in a note's title, that note will typically appear higher in the results than if the term only appears in the content.

### Highlighted Snippets

Each search result includes:

- The note title
- Highlighted snippets showing your search terms in context
- Tags associated with the note

The highlighted snippets help you quickly determine if a note contains the information you're looking for without having to open it.

### No Results Found

If your search returns no results:

- Check for typos in your search query
- Try using fewer or different terms
- Consider if the information might be stored using different terminology

## Troubleshooting

### Search Not Working

If the search functionality isn't working as expected:

1. **Verify note directory**: Ensure you have selected a valid notes directory in the settings
2. **Check for indexing**: The first time you select a notes directory, it may take a moment to index all notes
3. **Try restarting**: If issues persist, try restarting the application

### Unexpected Results

If you're getting unexpected search results:

1. **Be more specific**: Refine your search query to be more specific
2. **Check for similar terms**: The search might be matching similar terms
3. **Verify note content**: Make sure the content you're looking for is actually in your notes

### Performance Issues

If search is running slowly:

1. **Use shorter queries**: Very long search queries can take longer to process
2. **Check note collection size**: Very large collections (thousands of notes) may take longer to search
3. **Consider organization**: Organizing notes into subdirectories won't affect search but may improve overall application performance
