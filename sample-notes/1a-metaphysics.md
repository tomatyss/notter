# Metaphysics

Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that examines the fundamental nature of reality, including the relationship between mind and matter, between substance and attribute, and between potentiality and actuality.

## Key Questions

- What exists?
- What is the nature of objects and their properties?
- What is space and time?
- What is causality?

## Major Theories

- **Materialism**: Only physical matter exists
- **Idealism**: Only mental phenomena exist
- **Dualism**: Both mental and physical substances exist

Metaphysics provides the foundation for all other philosophical inquiry.
