# Gettier Problems

Gettier problems are philosophical thought experiments that challenge the traditional definition of knowledge as "justified true belief" (JTB).

## The Challenge

Edmund Gettier showed in 1963 that it's possible to have justified true belief that doesn't constitute knowledge.

## Classic Example

Smith believes Jones will get the job and Jones has 10 coins in his pocket. Smith concludes "The person who gets the job has 10 coins in his pocket." 

But Smith gets the job instead, and coincidentally, Smith also has 10 coins in his pocket. Smith's belief is:
- True (he got the job and has 10 coins)
- Justified (based on his evidence about Jones)
- But not knowledge (due to the coincidence)

## Responses

- **Add a fourth condition**: No false lemmas, safety, sensitivity
- **Reject JTB entirely**: Reliabilism, virtue epistemology
- **Contextualism**: Knowledge depends on context

Gettier problems revolutionized epistemology and continue to generate debate.
