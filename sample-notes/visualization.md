# Note Visualization Techniques

Visualizing notes and their relationships can help in understanding complex topics and discovering new connections.

## Graph-Based Visualization

Graph-based visualization represents notes as nodes and relationships as edges. This approach is useful for:

- Seeing the overall structure of your knowledge
- Identifying clusters of related notes
- Finding central concepts that connect multiple topics

## Timeline Visualization

Timeline visualization arranges notes chronologically, which is helpful for:

- Understanding the evolution of ideas over time
- Planning projects with sequential steps
- Reviewing historical events or developments

## Tag-Based Visualization

Tag-based visualization groups notes by their tags, which is useful for:

- Organizing notes by topic or category
- Finding related notes across different areas
- Identifying the most common themes in your notes
