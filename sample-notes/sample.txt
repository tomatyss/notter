This is a sample plain text note.

It contains multiple paragraphs and demonstrates how plain text files are displayed in Notter.

#plaintext #sample #testing

You can see that tags are extracted from anywhere in the content, not just at the beginning of lines.

This note should appear in the note list alongside markdown notes, but it will be rendered differently in the note viewer.
