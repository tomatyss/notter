USING NOTE LINKS IN PLAIN TEXT

This is an example of using note links in a plain text file. The same [[Note Title]] syntax works in both Markdown and plain text files.

EXAMPLES:

- [[Welcome to Notter]] - Link to the welcome note
- [[Rust and Tauri]] - Link to information about Rust and Tauri
- [[Note Visualization Techniques]] - Link to visualization techniques
- [[Using Note Links]] - Link to the note about using links

BENEFITS:

1. Consistent syntax across file types
2. Simple and intuitive to use
3. Works with existing notes without special formatting
4. Preserves readability even when viewed in other text editors

HOW TO USE:

Just type double square brackets around the exact title of the note you want to link to:

[[Note Title]]

These links will be clickable when viewing the note in Notter.
