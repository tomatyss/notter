- [[Rust and Tauri]] - Information about Rust and Tauri
- [[Note Visualization Techniques]] - Learn about different visualization techniques

## Benefits of Note Linking

1. **Easy Navigation**: Quickly jump between related notes
2. **Knowledge Connection**: Create a web of interconnected ideas
3. **Context Preservation**: Maintain context when exploring topics
4. **Discoverability**: Find related notes you might have forgotten

## How to Create Links

To create a link to another note, simply type double square brackets around the exact title of the note:

```
[[Note Title]]
```

When viewing the note, these links will be clickable and will navigate to the linked note.
