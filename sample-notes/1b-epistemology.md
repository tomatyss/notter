# Epistemology

Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with knowledge, justified belief, and the rationality of belief.

## Central Questions

- What is knowledge?
- How is knowledge acquired?
- What makes beliefs justified?
- What are the sources and limits of knowledge?

## Classical Definition

Knowledge is traditionally defined as "justified true belief" (JTB), though this has been challenged by Gettier problems.

## Sources of Knowledge

- **Empiricism**: Knowledge comes from sensory experience
- **Rationalism**: Knowledge comes from reason and logic
- **Intuition**: Direct, immediate knowledge
- **Testimony**: Knowledge from others

## Modern Developments

- Reliabilism
- Virtue epistemology
- Social epistemology
- Feminist epistemology

Understanding how we know what we know is fundamental to all intellectual inquiry.
