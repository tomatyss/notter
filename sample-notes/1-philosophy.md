# Philosophy

This is the main philosophy note that explores fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, and reality.

## Core Areas

- Metaphysics: What is the nature of reality?
- Epistemology: How do we know what we know?
- Ethics: What is right and wrong?
- Logic: How do we reason correctly?

Philosophy has been central to human thought for millennia, providing frameworks for understanding our place in the universe.
