# Mind-Body Problem

The mind-body problem is a fundamental issue in metaphysics concerning the relationship between mental states and physical states.

## The Problem

How can mental phenomena (thoughts, feelings, consciousness) relate to or arise from physical processes in the brain?

## Historical Perspectives

- **Descartes**: Mind and body are separate substances (substance dualism)
- **Spinoza**: Mind and body are two aspects of the same substance
- **Berkeley**: Only minds and ideas exist (idealism)

## Modern Approaches

- **Physicalism**: Mental states are identical to brain states
- **Functionalism**: Mental states are defined by their functional role
- **Property Dualism**: Mental properties are non-physical properties of physical substances

This problem remains one of the most challenging in philosophy of mind.
